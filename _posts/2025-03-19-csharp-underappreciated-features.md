C# is packed with amazing features, but some of them donâ€™t get the attention they deserve. Today, I want to highlight a few **underrated** C# features that can make your code cleaner, faster, and more maintainable!

#### ðŸ”¹ **Tuples: A Quick and Elegant Way to Return Multiple Values**

Ever needed to return **multiple values** from a method but didnâ€™t want to create a separate class or struct? Enter **Tuples**!

ðŸ’¡ Instead of:

You can return multiple values in a single, **easy-to-read** way. Itâ€™s great for small, **lightweight** data structures where you donâ€™t need full classes.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Records: The Simple Way to Create Immutable Objects**

If you work with **data models** that donâ€™t change, records can make your code more concise:

âœ… Less boilerplate  
âœ… Built-in value equality  
âœ… Ideal for **DTOs** and **immutable objects**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Span<T>: Supercharged Performance for Memory Efficiency**

Working with large arrays, slices, or buffers? `Span<T>` helps reduce unnecessary allocations:

âœ… Zero allocations  
âœ… Faster processing  
âœ… Perfect for performance-critical applications
